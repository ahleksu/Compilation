    <string name="fib_desc">The Fibonacci numbers Fn have the initial values \nF0 = 0, F1 = 1, and the recursion Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2 if n > 2. \n\nThe Fibonacci sequence is a set of integers that starts with 0 and 1, where each subsequent number is the sum of the two preceding numbers.</string>

    <!-- EUCLIDEAN ALGORITHM -->
    <string name="euc_name">Euclidean Algorithm</string>
    <string name="euc_desc">In mathematics, the Euclidean algorithm is an efficient method for computing the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers.\n\nThe GCD is the largest number that divides the two integers without a remainder. While, the Least Common Multiple (LCM) is used to find the smallest positive integer that is divisible by two or more given integers.</string>

    <!-- COLLATZ SEQUENCE -->
    <string name="col_name">Collatz Sequence</string>
    <string name="col_desc">The Collatz sequence is a sequence of numbers relevant to the Collatz conjecture, which theorizes that any number using this algorithm will eventually be reduced to 1.\n\nThe initial value can be any POSITIVE ODD INTEGER. If the previous term is odd, use 3n + 1 to obtain the next term. If the previous term is even, it is divided by 2.</string>
